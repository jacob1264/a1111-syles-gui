# a1111-syles-gui
A basic GUI styles.csv editor based in tkinter for Stable Diffusion Automatic1111 release.
I made this quickly to deal with my frustrations in dealing with A1111's styles dropdown and it's lack of basic features.

Add to the Stable Diffusion Automatic 1111 web release root folder and run with python

## Features

* Rename Styles
* Delete Styles
* Create New Styles
* Copy Styles
* Edit Prompts and Negative Prompt

## Future

* This would be better as an A1111 extension
* I am not planning on updating this
